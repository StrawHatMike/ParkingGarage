# ParkingGarage
This app allows you to setup a Parking Garage where an attendant will park and retieve cars.
You can sign in and out under different attendant accounts and even ask the manager account to make more accounts.
The Manager Account will only make new accounts and will not effect the state of the garage.
The database is under Google Firebase and is connected multiple times with account data and garage data.
See the UML diagrams under Design to see how it all connects.
The GUI is composed of many images such as Car, Motorcycle and Truck photos to add dimensions to the UI.
The garage itself is also a picture that is linked directly throught the XML file to the data in Firebase.
